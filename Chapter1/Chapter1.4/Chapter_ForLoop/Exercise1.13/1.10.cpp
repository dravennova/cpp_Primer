//Prompt: Rewrite the exercises from ยง 1.4.1 (p. 13) using for loops.

//Exercise Prompt: In addition to the ++ operator that adds 1 to its operand, there is a decrement operator (--) 
//that subtracts 1. Use the decrement operator to write a while that prints the 
//numbers from ten down to zero.
